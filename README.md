## Fuzzy Logic Level Control of a Cylindrical Water Tank
Consider a cylindrical water tank. Water enters the tank from the top at a rate proportional to the voltage, V, applied to the pump. The water leaves through an opening in the tank base at a rate that is proportional to the square root of the water height, H, in the tank. The presence of the square root in the water flow rate results in a nonlinear plant.
